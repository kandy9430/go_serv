Simple live server using golang. For my personal webdev projects.

This branch was to add auto-reload feature to restart the server. It has since been merged with file_watcher branch to auto-reload the server when there are changes to files being watched. 

Keeping branch around for now in case there are any bugs that need to be tested later.
